I recommend downloading/printing the required readings ahead of time, just in case.)

Read only the following:

1. Chapter 1
  * Background
  * The Birth of Git
2. Chapter 3: Getting Started
  * Intro
  * The Git Command Line
  * Quick Introduction to Using Git (read all sections)
  * Configuration files (Intro only, may skip part on aliases)
3. Chapter 4: Basic Git Concepts
  * Basic concepts (read all)
  * Object store pictures
  * Git concepts at work (read all)
4. Chapter 21: Git and Github

Open Data Structures in C++. Morin.

Read the following:

1. Chapter 1 (pp. 1-20)

Homework
========

1. Create an account with github.com. You may select the free account. If you want to get some free private repos, you may apply at https://github.com/edu
2. Go to https://github.com/MiamiOH-CSE274/01_Git_and_Intro and fork the repo, which will create a copy of it in your github account.
3. Install git on your computer, if you do not already have it. I recommend installing http://windows.github.com/ if you use windows, or http://mac.github.com/ if you use Mac. HOWEVER, I highly recommend using the command-line tools for everything, and ignoring the GUI. I will not be providing help with configuring/using the GUI.
4. Clone your repo from github to your computer. When you are at the web page for your repo, `https://github.com/[your github id]/01_Git_and_Intro`, you will see info about how to clone it. The easiest way is to go to the command line terminal, and type `git clone git@github.com:[your github id]/01_Git_and_Intro.git`
5. Checkout your personal branch from the repo. Each student has a branch labeled by their Miami uniqueid. `git checkout uniqueid` ... for example, I would do `git checkout brinkmwj`
6. Complete the exercises below by modifying this file.
7. After you complete each answer, be sure to create a new commit with the changes (using `git add README.md` and `git commit -m` as appropriate). Also, be sure to upload to github frequently by using `git push`
8. If I don't see at least 4-5 commits on this homework, I'm going to be unhappy.

Exercises
=========

Morin, Exercise 1.1 (p. 23)
---------


Your choice: Morin, Exercise 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4 (pick one)
---------

Note: You should not need to write any real computer code for any of these. Instead, explain how you would approach the problem using a combination of English and pseudocode. The goal is to write something that is understandable by any programmer, even if the two of you have never used the same computer language. (In other words, assume the other person does not know the syntax of Java or C/C++, but knows the basic programming constructs such as for loops, if statements, variables, and so on.)
